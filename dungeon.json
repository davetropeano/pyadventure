Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are myriad twisted\nformations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter the murky\nlight into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one side is a deep\ngorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured rock which seems to\nhave been crafted by the devil himself.  An immense river of fire\ncrashes out from the depths of the volcano, burns its way through the\ngorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit far off to your left.  To\nthe right, an immense geyser of blistering steam erupts continuously\nfrom a barren island in the center of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles\nominously.  The far right wall is aflame with an incandescence of its\nown, which lends an additional infernal splendor to the already\nhellish scene.  A dark, foreboding passage exits to the south."

To move, try words\nlike forest, building, downstream, enter, east, west, north, south,\nup, or down.  I know about a few special objects, like a black rod\nhidden in the cave.  These objects can be manipulated using some of\nthe action words that I know.  Usually you will need to give both the\nobject and action words (in either order), but sometimes I can infer\nthe object from the verb alone.  Some objects also imply verbs; in\nparticular, \"inventory\" implies \"take inventory\", which causes me to\ngive you a list of what you're carrying.  Some objects have unexpected\neffects; the effects are not always desirable!  Usually people having\ntrouble moving just need to try a few more words.  Usually people\ntrying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object are attempting something\nbeyond their (or my!) capabilities and should try a completely\ndifferent tack.  One point often confusing to beginners is that, when\nthere are several ways to go in a certain direction (e.g., if there\nare several holes in a wall), choosing that direction in effect\nchooses one of the ways at random; often, though, by specifying the\nplace you want to reach you can guarantee choosing the right path.\nAlso, to speed the game you can sometimes move long distances with a\nsingle word.  For example, \"building\" usually gets you to the building\nfrom anywhere above ground except when lost in the forest.  Also, note\nthat cave passages and forest paths turn a lot, so leaving one place\nheading north doesn't guarantee entering the next from the south.\nHowever (another important point), except when you've used a \"long\ndistance\" word such as \"building\", there is always a way to go back\nwhere you just came from unless I warn you to the contrary, even\nthough the direction that takes you back might not be the reverse of\nwhat got you here.  Good luck, and have fun!",
